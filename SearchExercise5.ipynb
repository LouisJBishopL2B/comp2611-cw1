        "In this exercise we consider a true AI type of situation. We have a robot that can help us by carrying items between the rooms of a building (e.g. a home or factory) and we want to give it the \"intelligence\" to put the items where we want them. We also want it do deal with some constraining factors, such as it having limited strength to carry heavy objects, and perhaps soem doors may be locked and a key will be needed to open them.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise we shall see how we can implement an AI capable of solving this kind of action planning problem by working out a sequence of actions that can _potentially_ acheive any possibe goal.\n",
        "I say _potentially_ because this kind of problem can get extremely computationally intensive if we have more than a small number of possible state variable values. These variable values would correspond to information such as possible robot locations, room contents, doors that could be open or locked etc.. The search algorithm may need to try thousands or millions (or more!) action combinations to find a successful action sequence and the number of possible sequences will grow exponentially as the number variables and possible values increases.\n",

        "The code below defines some objects and dictionaries that are used to specify possible states of affairs that could occur as the robot carries out actions. The robot is in a certain location, can carry items and has a given strength. Doors connect rooms (e.g. in a factory) and can have keys and can be in a state of either being locked or unlocked. The initial contents of rooms and the weights of these items are specified. The complete `State` object includes the `Robot` object, a list of `Door` objects and a `ROOM_CONTENTS` dictionary.\n",

        "### A complication: need unique string representations of state for the loop checker\n",
        "One thing that you will notice in the following code is that I have defined a `__repr__` (representation) method for each of the classes that I define. This gives a unique string representation for these objects. The purpose of this is to provide an identifier for each state that can be efficiently stored and used for loop checking when the `loop_check` options is set. (The `search` algorithm takes care of this automatically, storing the `__repr__(state)` for every state that gets put in the queue. If the same state gets generated again later, it is discarded, not put in the queue. Note that loop checking is often very useful but does have its own computational cost, which sometime outweights its benefit.)\n",
